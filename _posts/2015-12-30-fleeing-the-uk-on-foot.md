This Christmas I am doing what most of my friends are doing... fleeing London in search of friends and family. Except that unlike most of my friends, I won't be taking a train or a plane.

On the 17th December 2015, I will embark on the longest run of my life - as I leave my home in East London and make my way on foot to my friend's house in the Netherlands.

The entire journey will take me 6 days - averaging between 13-20 miles a day

Why?

Well, there are many reasons - even if there are no good ones. But in short I have found joy this year in exploring this world on foot.

It is a truly unique way to experience both places and people. And every small step I have taken, has helped me find an even greater appreciation of my life.

This journey is going to challenge me more than anything I've undertaken so far in my life. But at the same time I am looking forward to getting to know both myself, and the country I live in, even better.

But even as I willingly embark on journey, my heart goes out to the hundreds of thousands of people who have been forced to undertake infinitely harder, longer and more dangerous journeys.

My biggest fear on this trip is the cold. And yet, while I have the means to pay for a warm meal and a bed at the end of every day, most of these people do not. I can't even imagine what this is like.

Which is why I have set up a JustGiving page to raise money for the UNHCR - The UN Refugee Agency.

If you would like to express your support for my journey, then I would be very grateful for any contributions that you might spare at this time. Your support really does mean a lot.
